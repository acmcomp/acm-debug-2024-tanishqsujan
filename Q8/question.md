The Dev Bootcamp series was amazing! Learnt a lot of new stuff!

I thought that it would be better for me if I tried to code out the same thing by myself using all the latest versions of the software involved.

But.. a bunch of issues came up, someone, please help me out..

## Issues

1. API Key variable not found.. what could be the reason.. maybe I missed something?

2. Unable to load templates and static files.. I did exactly the process followed in the bootcamp, still nope..

3. A random SQL error pops up.. no idea how to fix it..

4. Unable to submit forms: I was playing around with the forms, now getting some error..

5. The feedback carousel does not work anymore..
