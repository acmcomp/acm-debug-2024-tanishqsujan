# Question 6: JSON Debugging Challenge (Medium)

## Problem

The following Flask app should return a JSON response, but it's not working as expected. Participants need to debug it:

```python
from flask import Flask, jsonify
from dataclasses import dataclass

class User:
    name: str
    age: int

    def __init__(self, name: str, age: int):
        self.name = name
        self.age = age

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route("/data", methods=["GET"])
def get_data():
    user = User(name="Alice", age=30)
    return user


if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run(debug=True)

```

**Expected Behavior:**
Visiting /data should return {"name": "Alice", "age": 30} as a JSON response.

**Current Behavior:**
TypeError: The view function did not return a valid response. The return type must be a string, dict, list, tuple with headers or status, Response instance, or WSGI callable, but it was a User.
